# Naive-Bayes-algorithm-From-Scratch
replicating Naive Bayes  algorithms from scratch that  # Restrict to only categorical features   # Give an error message if continuous features are provided   # Function must have at least three parameters: Train, Test, Classification variable   # Output produces predicted probability and classification  #Use Titanic data to predict survival.
